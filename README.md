   ```
### mount-dir
Mount-dir argument is to specify the path for storing the photo / video assets. By default it is `/media` at raspberry pi, all external USB disks should also be mounted under this directory, so that `lomod` can read the list of USB disks and return to mobile client. User can also select the desired disks when user is created. The user's home path is `mount-dir + <usb disk UUID> + <user name>`.

If user doesn't use external USB disk, he needs add `--no-mount` option, thus, lomod will use `mount-dir + <user name>` as user's home path.
### preview-size-video
Video preview generation takes more system resources. If server has less compute resource, user can specify `preview-size-video=0` to disable video preview generation
